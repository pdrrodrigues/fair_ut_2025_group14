# FAIR Data Engineering Project  

This repository hosts the project developed for the **FAIR Data Engineering** course at the University of Twente (UT), academic year **2025–2026**.  

The goal is to apply **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to a real dataset, improving its metadata, semantics, and structure.  

Deliverables include the FAIRified and original dataset, the ontology used on the FAIRified dataset, the metadata of this new version of dataset and the rules to validate this metadata.

This repository is structured in multiple folders for clarity.
